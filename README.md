moodle-scorm-rankings
=====================

Moodle SCORM reports are only available for Moodle users with teacher role. However, there educational scenarios that require to have access to this reports by the students, for example, to add a gasification strategy to the course, in order to foster the competition between students. This project addresses this problem, providing the ability to generate a student rank in a particular SCORM activity that can be later on accessed by the students. The objective of this project has been to create a Moodle extension that is simple to use and have zero-installation requirements in the Moodle server. This plugin runs completely in the user browser requiring only the teacher intervention, in order to generate or update the student ranking. Once the ranking has been generated is possible to include some automatically generated JavaScript as a Moodle block in order to show the students ranking.
